This website is dedicated to the artist Daniel Caesar, whose music I deeply admire. The goal of the site is to celebrate his work while also offering an interactive fan experience beyond a typical information page. The design is inspired by the album “NEVER ENOUGH”, using a consistent visual theme across all pages to create a cohesive identity.

Design Process. 
The site is organised into four main sections: Home, Music, Concert, and Merch. The Home page introduces the artist and sets the tone of the website, while the Music section showcases his releases through a clean, scrollable layout that can adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.
A key feature of this project is the Concert Selection section. Instead of only displaying concert information, it allows users to actively choose the date they want to attend by selecting from available dates, like a real ticket-booking interface. This makes the site more engaging and gives it a more realistic, functional purpose.
Another major feature is the Merchandise section, where users can browse items, add products to a cart, and proceed to checkout. The cart updates dynamically so users can review their selected items and total cost before confirming their purchase. Overall, this website combines an appreciation for Daniel Caesar’s artistry with practical interactive features to create a more immersive fan-focused experience.
Features: Allow users to listen to the artist's top songs on youtube, by having a link to click on. Secondly, users are able to select from 4 different dates and 3 seat categories on the concert page. Thirdly, users are able to select their sizes on merches, and search for a specific merch they want. They are then able to go to their cart and view their items and checkout.

Throughout the development process, I frequently evaluated how the website looked and functioned on both desktop and mobile devices. Rather than designing for a single screen size, I continuously tested the layout at different widths to ensure that elements such as navigation buttons, images, and text adjusted correctly. This helped me maintain a consistent visual style while avoiding issues such as overlapping content or excessive scrolling on smaller screens.

I paid close attention to responsive behaviour by refining spacing, font sizes, and container dimensions so that the site remained readable and intuitive on mobile devices. By regularly switching between desktop and mobile views during development, I was able to make informed design decisions and ensure that the website provided a smooth and user-friendly experience across all platforms.

The text for the home page is from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Caesar
The photos used in this site were obtained from https://www.youtube.com/@DanielCaesar, Google.
I received inspiration for this project from one of the examples that my lecturer had shown.
